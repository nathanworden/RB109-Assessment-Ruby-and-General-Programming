# Write a method that returns the number of Friday the 13ths in the year
# passed in as an argument. You amy assume that the year is greater than 
# 1752 (when the modern Gregorian Calendar was adobpted by the United 
# Kingdom), and you may assume that the same calendar will remain in use
# for the foreseeable future.

# Examples
# friday_13th?(2015) == 3
# friday_13th?(1986) == 1

# Hint: Ruby's Date class could be helpful here

# Look at how to initialize a Date object
# look at he 'Friday?' method
